Section 3 - Introduction to Ruby on Rails 

Model View Controller (MVC) - Rails App Structure 
- Separation of presentation layer (what the user of the application sees in the browser/mobile device) and the business-logic or back-end invisible layer. 
- You can use Models to interact with the data in your tables.
- Views make up the visible layer of your app. What the users will see. (html, CSS, JS) 
- Controllers are the brains behind the app. Logic for how things operate to user interaction
